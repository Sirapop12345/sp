Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport (bike riding, bus) outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.\\n\\nNow more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France (\\\"Paris bans driving due to smog\\\", source two), where the goverment took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.\\n\\nParis, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate matter/cubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an inprovement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems; Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the \\\"Day Without Cars event\\\"(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3). In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.\\n\\nOne could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn't be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn't necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver's licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then (The End of Car Culture, Source 4). People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding biclycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.\\n\\nSo with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There''s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency.    \",\n          \"The Face That Scared The World\\n\\nWe have all hear about this \\\"Face\\\" right ? , Well if you haven't Is really just a landform. The other Scientists has all of these people rallied up because they think that aliens are to exist. That cannot be possible because , if aliens existed then why are we just finding them? Wouldn't we already have proof of their existence ?\\n\\nThen Again , there are all types of landforms on earth some man made and more of the natural kind , So basically what you guys are saying is that if we find landform that looks like something is automatically aliens ??? what about mount rushmore ? That is a man made structure not saying that the \\\"face\\\" is man made but its just not relevant to get all of this contrversy about something that we barely know about .\\n\\nSo Therefore, You guys really dont know what the structure is. none of us know what \\\"it\\\" really is , It might look like a face but aliens are just not relevant enough to believe that they actually did something of this nature. i personally do Not believe in aliens , well would you blame me ? We have been to the moon, we have had a rover on mars for years ! and what do we get? nothing , just a rocky surface . no aliens , no water , No life period.\\n\\nNevertheless, even though in paragraph 10 it says, \\\"that that put out The maximum camera resoulution and each pixel spans 1.56 meters thats still not giving us any proof . We have been on this \\\"Aliens Are Real\\\" Stuff for a while now , and we dont have nothing that proves it. Don't you guys think that we should just cut it all out the picture ? we are wasting money on absoutely NOTHING.\\n\\nFinally , as I finish my statement I will just say that im'm not telling you guys to give up on your research , Not at all . but all I am saying is That If your gonna try and find these \\\"aliens\\\" of yours Atleast have some proof of their existance. Then Maybe I'll Believe You all when You do it. Thats all i have to say , I plead my case now . Goodluck with your research .    \",\n          \"Dear Senator, The Electoral College should not be the deciding vote for the president of the United States of America. Every popular vote of the people should be counted towards deciding the next president. If America is a democracy and in a democracy people pick the leader then every citizen's vote should count, not just the majority.\\n\\nFirst things first, only a few states have taken action towards my claim. Those being Maine and Nebraska. These states have made a \\\"proportional representation\\\", which is unlike the \\\"winner take all\\\" that the other 48 states have adopted. The text states \\\"Most states have a winner take all method system that awards all electorss to the winning presidential candidate\\\" What Is the Electoral College?7.This portrays that with the \\\"winner take all\\\" method various amounts of U.S. citizen votes have gone unaccounted for.\\n\\nMultiple occasions have dimmed the surface of our elections where their voices aren't heard. The author says \\\"faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please\\\" Plumer 11. Going into this further, that means that one person can disagree with hundreds of people's votes for his own vote of the opposite party. Also, if a tie was to occur int the total electorsal votes then the outcome would be put into the hands of the House of representatives. If the people were to vote in the first place this occurance would have never came close.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is much harder to calculate the total number of the popular vote being that there are millions of people voting. It is much easier to count and not dispute over a hundred or so votes than a million. But, having people know that their vote doesn't make it to actually voting for the president makes them not as enthusiastic about voting. The text says \\\"no voter's vote swings an election\\\"Posner 23. This explains why only about one half of eligible American voters voted.\\n\\nIn conclusion, America is a democracy, which means people elect the president, not a electors but the people. The author states \\\"The electorsal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\\\" Plumer 14. This further explains that electorss cannot make decisions without being biased toward their party. Also portraying well, the feelings of many Americans who feel the same way.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Grades for extracurricular activities\",\n          \"Does the electoral college work?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"radek_500\",\n          \"text-davinci-001\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"RDizzl3_seven\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They can even ask questions and get help from the teacher.\\n\\nSometime students might not understand something and they can rewind the video and watch it agen. This way they can make shure they understand it befor they move on to the next lesson. They can even pause the video and take notes.\\n\\nAnother good thing about distance learning is that students can work at there own pace. If they need more time to understand somethig they can take it. If they are fast learner they can go ahed and finish the work early.\\n\\nSome students might not like being in a classroom with lots of other students. They might feel nervus or shy. With distance learning they can learn in there own space and feel more comfortable.\\n\\nI think that distance learning is a good option for students.

Some peoples think we need stricter laws to control guns. Other peoples think that's a bad idea. I think we need stricter gun control laws.\\n\\nFirst of all, guns are really dangerous. They can kill peoples. There's been lots of mass shootings in America, like at schools and in movie theaters. If there were stricter gun control laws, it would be harder for peoples to get their hands on guns and do these bad things.\\n\\nAnother reason is that some peoples are not responsible enough to own guns. They might get mad and use it to hurt someone. Or they might leave it where a kid can find it and accidentally shoot themselves. If we had stricter laws, we could make sure that only responsible peoples can own guns.\\n\\nSome peoples say that stricter gun control laws would take away our right to protect ourselves. But that's not true. We can still have guns for protection, but we need to make sure they're used safely. We can have background checks and waiting periods to make sure peoples are ready to own a gun.\\n\\nFinally, stricter gun control laws would help stop criminals from getting guns. Now, they can just go to a store and buy one. If it was harder to get a gun, they might not even try.\\n\\nIn conclusion, stricter gun control laws would make our communities safer and prevent bad things from happening. We need to make sure that only responsible peoples can own guns, and that they use them safely.\\n\\nPlease provide feedback to the essay in terms of content, organization, language use, and any specific errors.\\n\\nAlso, please provide a grade for the essay based on the level of writing skill demonstrated.\",\n          \"Minimum wage is a big issue in many countries. Some people think we should raise it, but others think we shouldn't. I think we should raise it.\\n\\nFirst of all, people who work full time should not be living in poverty. It's not fair that someone who works 40 hours a week can't even afford to pay their bills. If we raise the minimum wage, more people will be able to afford the things they need to live.\\n\\nAnother reason we should raise the minimum wage is that it will help the economy. When people have more money, they are more likely to spend it. This means they will buy more things, which will help businesses make more money. This will create more jobs and help the economy grow.\\n\\nRaising the minimum wage will also help reduce income inequality. Right now, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. If we raise the minimum wage, it will help level the playing field a bit. It's not fair that some people have so much money while others struggle to get by.\\n\\nFinally, raising the minimum wage will help people have better lives. They will be able to afford things like healthcare, education, and housing. These are basic human needs and everyone should have access to them.\\n\\nSome people argue that raising the minimum wage will lead to job losses. They say that businesses won't be able to afford to pay their employees more. But this isn't true. Many businesses can afford to pay their employees more, they just choose not to. And if they can't afford it, they shouldn't be in business.\\n\\nIn conclusion, raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do. It will help people afford the things they need, help the economy, reduce income inequality, and give people better lives. We should all be able to live with dignity and respect, and raising the minimum wage will help make that happen.\\n\\nPlease provide feedback on the essay, including suggestions for improvement, and identify any grammatical or spelling errors.\\n\\nAlso, please provide your own opinion on the topic of raising the minimum wage and why you hold that position.\\n\\nThank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And its not just, like, random peoples who can see it, its also like, companies and stuff. They can use our personal info to like, sell us stuff and stuff and its just, really not cool.\\n\\nLike, I know some peoples who have had theyre identities stolen and its like, super hard to get it back. And like, they have to deal with alot of problems because of it. And its not just, like, them, it could happen to anyone. So yeah, I think we defintely need stronger privacy protections on sicial media.\\n\\nI also think that like, companies shouldnt be able to use our personal info without our permision. Its like, not fair that they can just, take our info and use it to make money off of us without even asking us. And like, what if we dont want them to have our info? Its like, we should have the right to say no, you know?\\n\\nAlso, like, I think that there should be laws in place to protect our privacy. Its like, not right that anyone can just, look at our personal info and use it for whatever they want. We need to have laws that protect us from that.\\n\\nSo yeah, I think stronger privacy protections on sicial media is defintely needed. Its important that we protect our personal info and make sure that it doesnt fall into the wrong hands.\\n\\nAs a grade 10 student, I hope that this essay has shown why privacy protections on social media are important.

While some people may argue that online learning is not as effective as traditional classroom learning, there are several advantages and disadvantages to consider. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of online learning, and examine different learning strategies that could be useful for home-schoolers. I will also discuss how to apply to online courses and how online courses can maximize the educational opportunities of home-schoolers. Finally, I will evaluate the cost benefit of utilizing online courses from home.\\n\\nAdvantages of Online Learning:\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of online learning is the flexibility it provides. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly beneficial for home-schoolers who may have other responsibilities, such as caring for younger siblings or working a part-time job. Additionally, online learning allows students to access a wider range of courses and subjects than they may be able to find in their local area. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing specialized or niche subjects.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Online Learning:\\n\\nWhile online learning offers many benefits, it also has its drawbacks. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of interaction with other students and teachers. In a traditional classroom setting, students have the opportunity to ask questions and collaborate with their peers. This can be more difficult to achieve in an online environment, where students may feel isolated or disconnected from their classmates. Additionally, online learning requires a certain level of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging for some students.\\n\\nLearning Strategies for Home-Schoolers:\\n\\nTo maximize the educational opportunities of online learning, home-schoolers should employ a variety of learning strategies. One effective strategy is to create a dedicated study space that is free from distractions. This can help students focus and be more productive. Additionally, home-schoolers should establish a routine that includes regular study time, breaks, and opportunities for physical activity. This can help maintain a healthy work-life balance and prevent burnout.\\n\\nApplying to Online Courses:\\n\\nWhen applying to online courses, home-schoolers should carefully consider their course requirements and prerequisites. They should also research the course format and delivery method to ensure that\",\n          \"Title: My Dream Vacation and How I Can Help\\n\\nHey there!  I'm super excited to write about my favorite hobbies, places I want to visit, and my dream vacation. I also can't wait to help someone in need and form a bond with them. \\n\\nSo, my favorite hobby is playing video games.  I love immersing myself in different worlds and challenges, and it's a great way to relax after a long day at school.  I also enjoy reading books, especially adventure and fantasy novels. They transport me to magical realms and inspire my imagination. \\n\\nAs for places I want to visit, I've always been fascinated by Japan.  I want to try all the delicious food, learn about the culture, and visit famous landmarks like Mount Fuji and the Tokyo Tower.  I've also heard amazing things about Hawaii's beaches and would love to experience the tropical paradise. \\n\\nNow, my dream vacation is to go on a road trip across the United States.  I want to see the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park, and the Golden Gate Bridge.  I'd also love to visit famous cities like New York and Los Angeles and experience the vibrant culture. \\n\\nBut, I know not everyone has the means to go on a dream vacation, so I want to help someone make their dreams come true.  Whether it's helping with a fundraiser or simply being a listening ear, I want to make a difference in someone's life. \\n\\nTo start forming a bond with someone, I think communication is key.  I'd love to chat with them over text, go shopping together, or even watch movies.  I believe shared experiences can bring people closer together and create lasting memories. \\n\\nLastly, I think teamwork is essential in any bond.  Whether it's working on a project or just having\",\n          \"Introduction:\\nIn \\\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\\\" the author argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author provides several reasons to support this idea. However, I believe that the author could have done a better job of convincing the reader that studying Venus is worth the risk.\\n\\nBody:\\nFirstly, the author mentions that exploring Venus could help us understand the formation of the solar system and the history of our planet. This is a valid point, but the author does not provide any concrete evidence to support this claim. It would have been more convincing if the author had cited some studies or research that prove this point.\\n\\nSecondly, the author suggests that exploring Venus could help us find solutions to the problems we are facing on Earth, such as climate change and pollution. While this is a compelling argument, the author does not provide any specific examples of how studying Venus could lead to such solutions. It would have been more convincing if the author had provided some examples of how exploring Venus has led to solutions to similar problems on Earth.\\n\\nLastly, the author argues that exploring Venus could inspire future generations to pursue careers in science and technology. This is a valid point, but the author does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It would have been more convincing if the author had cited some studies or research that show how exploring Venus has inspired young people to pursue careers in science and technology.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, while the author makes some valid points about the benefits of studying Venus, I believe that the author could have done a better job of supporting these points with concrete evidence. Without specific examples and research to back up the claims, it is difficult to fully agree with the author's argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This photo that was taken on NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, as it was searching for possible landing sites. This \\\"face\\\" is nothing but a natural landfrom that happens to look like a face. There are many persuasive and factual reasons to back up the fact that there has been no alien formation on Mars.\\n\\nFirst, there has been no real, hard evidence that this human-like figure is actually a face. The article \\\"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\\\" even says,\\\"it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\\\" (Notice, it said likeness.) Just because one article and a Hollywood movie says that this was alien created, doesn't mean it really was.\\n\\nAlso, any natural landforms can look like something it is not. Have you ever looked at a rock or even a cloud and said, \\\"Wow, that looks like a [insert object or name]!\\\" There have been plenty of instances in which something has been mistaken to be someting it is not. For example, The Little Dipper, as we call it, is said to look like a spoon. Does that mean that there is a big, shiny spoon in the sky? Of couse not, so why should we say the same about a formation of rocks on Mars that happen to look like a face.\\n\\nLastly, NASA has even confirmed that this is just a natural rock formation. I know this because, NASA unveiled an image of this \\\"face\\\" and captioned it, \\\"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth.\\\" So, this rock's shadows have given the illusion of a human-like face, which leads to the assumption that there is no real face.\\n\\nYou might be thinking,\\\" Well, why did the people who discovered this even release the information if it wasn't comepletely factual.\\\" This is beacuse of the conspiracy theorists. Think about it , if you would have never heard about this Face on Earth in books, magazines, and radio talk shows, would you have believed it? NASA is a very trustworthy and credible association and if information wasn't released until it was proven true than none of this would have happened.\\n\\nIn conlusion, the Face on Earth is nothing but a myth, until there are reliable discoveries that have declared it real. Since there is no evidence that there has been alien formation on Earth, it is just a hoax. I hope I have given a sufficent amount of reasons to argue that the Face is not a face.          \",\n          \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nMany people use their phones while they are driving. About 390,000 injuries happen each month due to someone distracted by their phone. Using a phone while driving is dangerous, and it needs to stop. Two ways that we can stop this are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones.\\n\\nEven though there are already laws against using your phone while driving, they should be more heavily enforced. Law breakers should have to pay a fine for putting other drivers' lives in danger. If it is still done after they are fined, they should face jail time. For the third offence, they should lose their licenses. That will be an effective way to stop some drivers from losing their attention to the road by using their phones.\\n\\nMore hands-free software should be added to phones. The hands-free software should be mandatory to have on every phone. They should have it where you can answer calls and reply to text messages with your voice to minimize concentration loss from the road. It would be a great idea to make it mandatory to add a hands-free software to each phone before they go on the market shelves.\\n\\nIn conclusion, ways to stop phones and driving are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones. If these actions are carried out proficiently, up to 421,000 incidents related to phones and driving could be prevented each year.\\n\\n[Last Name] 4\\n\\n[Last Name] 1            \",\n          \"Required Essay: Phones & Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans use their cell phones on a daily basis. Over the years humans have developed new ways to communicate with others in throughout their lives. As the years progress technology has been a part of our lives and we cannot \\\"function\\\" without it. We have adapted to technology so much we use it in our everyday. But technology does not always make a positive impact on our lives. We just need to know how to use it.\\n\\nWe use our phones so much it's beginning to be too much. We use it when we walk, eat, etc. But most dangerously when we are driving. Our phones cause a big distraction that we do not pay attention to anything we do. Using our phones while we drive can lead to small, big, or even fatal accidents. Not just on the driver, but also anyone who is nearby. According to Edgar Snyder, approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phones while behind the wheel. In fact, using our phones and driving is the leading cause of death for teenagers today. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur every year because of accidents caused by using our phones and driving.\\n\\nAfter numerous accidents and injuries, most teenagers are pledging not to text and drive. The percentage of injuries involving the subject has dropped and is still dropping. Teenagers and other people have been spreading awareness to prevent any more car injuries involving phones. Technology will always be a part of our lives and will continue to become more advanced, but society needs to learn to use it responsibly.\\n\\n[Last Name] 2            \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

While helping the community is undoubtedly a virtue, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. There are better ways to encourage voluntary engagement.\\n\\nRequiring community service risks fostering resentment instead of goodwill. When an activity is compulsory, it can feel more like a chore or burden than a chance to help others. Students may go through the motions without deriving personal meaning from the experience. Community organizations also deserve partners who wish to contribute freely of their own accord, not because they have to. \\n\\nInstead of a mandate, I believe cultivating a spirit of volunteerism through promotion and leadership by example would be more effective. Our school can highlight the many rewarding community service opportunities available and encourage students to find projects that fit their interests and strengths. Personal inspiration is stronger than external obligation. Clubs and activities related to service can pique curiosity and show how meaningful impact starts small. \\n\\nLeading by volunteering ourselves, teachers and administrators can demonstrate good citizenship in action. Seeing the difference made through patience and compassion will motivate more students to volunteer than a policy alone ever could. A culture of care for others blossoms naturally when nourished by commitment from within, not enforced from without.\\n\\nWhile the intent is to strengthen our community, making service compulsory risks having the opposite effect. I ask that you reconsider moving forward with requirements and instead focus on inspiring voluntary participation through positivity, partnership and precedent. Our energy is best spent strengthening connections, not implementing rules. With compassion as our guide, I believe many students will choose to help for the right reasons.\\n\\nThank you for your consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]\",\n          \"Dear Principal, \\n\\nI am writing to respectfully provide my perspective on the proposed policy change to require students have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. While maintaining academic standards is important, implementing this policy could negatively impact students in several ways.\\n\\nRequiring a B average may discourage students who are working hard but still achieving Cs from participating in important programs that foster skills like teamwork, leadership, communication and time management. Being involved in sports and clubs can help motivate students to succeed in the classroom as well. For some students, these activities may be what keeps them engaged and progressing toward graduation. Excluding students who are sincerely trying but facing academic challenges risks damaging self-esteem and potential. \\n\\nThis policy could also place undue pressure on students already juggling busy schedules. Maintaining high grades is challenging, and extracurriculars offer healthy outlets for stress. Rather than incentives, stricter requirements may create anxiety that hinders performance. Students committed to both academics and activities will have to make sacrifices, losing opportunities for learning and growth. \\n\\nInstead of exclusion, I believe support and encouragement lead to greater success. Many students with C averages take difficult courses while excelling in other areas. A B cutoff does not consider individual circumstances or potential. Those committed to improvement could be banned for one slip. As an alternative, students below a B who meet regularly with teachers, attend study sessions, and show progress over time could qualify for conditional participation. \\n\\nIn closing, while maintaining standards is important, this policy risks damaging morale and limiting opportunities rather than motivating growth. Most students are already highly motivated to succeed in the classroom and community. With guidance and flexibility instead of strict requirements, our dedicated students will continue to represent our school well in all their pursuits. I hope these perspectives will be considered in addressing the objectives of academic excellence and well-rounded student development.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration. Please let me know if you have any other questions.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]\",\n          \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI am writing to you about the school's cell phone policy. I believe that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.\\n\\nFirst of all, having a cell phone at school can be very helpful in case of an emergency. If a student needs to contact their parents or guardians, they can easily do so with their phone. This can also help parents feel more connected to their children and know that they are safe.\\n\\nSecondly, cell phones can be a great tool for learning. With access to the internet, students can quickly look up information for class projects or assignments. There are also many educational apps that can help students with their studies.\\n\\nLastly, allowing students to have phones at school can help teach responsibility. Students will need to learn how to manage their time and not get distracted by their phones during class. This is an important skill that will benefit them in the future.\\n\\nI understand that some people may be concerned about students using their phones during class time. However, I believe that with clear rules and consequences, this can be easily managed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for our school's cell phone policy. It allows for the benefits of having a cell phone while also teaching responsibility and providing clear guidelines for appropriate use.\\n\\nThank you for considering my opinion.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It's where i can have my fun and skate and hang out with friends. If nobody did such a task, the world would look like one huge trash can, garbage can, dump, Etc.\\n\\nTo help with this important matter when we're done with our trash, we should put it in the right despoils can so that it is actually thrown away properly.\\n\\nBut this all should be an option. Nobody should have to do this if they want. Let them go play have fun while other kids work their butts off to make our planet a better place. When they see how their world is being treated, they'll do anything to help 'cause I know for a fact they won't want there \\\"playground\\\" to be all dirty.\\n\\nLet's just say you required community service. Do you actually know how many people would do that like for real? Maybe about 9% of the school. Some kids are always complain about everything. Hey, I'm one of those kids too. But there's always times when I know I HAVE to be serious. And when it's something like this, I'm totally serious.\\n\\nTo me I would back up you [TEACHER_NAME] for community service.

I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place to ensure that every vote counts and that every state has a voice in the election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a time-honored tradition that was established by the founding fathers of the United States. It was created to ensure that every state has a say in the election process, as opposed to just the states with larger populations. The Electoral College also ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, which is critical in a country as large as the United States.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also helps to prevent fraud in the election process. It makes it much more difficult for fraudulent votes to be cast, as there are multiple layers of protection in place to prevent fraudulent votes from being counted. This is especially important in a country as large as the United States, where there are many different states with many different voting laws and regulations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College provides a degree of stability to the election process. It ensures that the President is elected by a clear majority, which helps to prevent confusion and chaos in the election process. This is especially important in times of crisis, where stability is critical to the functioning of our democracy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place to ensure that every vote counts and that every state has a voice in the election. The Electoral College helps to prevent fraud, provides stability to the election process, and ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process. I urge you to support the Electoral College and to vote against any efforts to abolish it.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Student's Name]\",\n          \"[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator's Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear [State Senator's Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and advocate against the idea of changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College plays a crucial role in maintaining our democratic process and upholding the principles on which our founding fathers established this nation.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. With the winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and decisive outcome. As witnessed in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. This system minimizes the likelihood of a disputed election and provides a stable framework for the American people.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This forces candidates to campaign across the nation, appealing to voters from different backgrounds and perspectives. It ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to win the presidency and that all Americans feel represented in the highest office.\\n\\nFurthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This system gives a voice to the most thoughtful voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and neglecting the concerns and issues of smaller states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also balances the political power between large and small states. The system restores weight to large states that may otherwise lose their influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. For instance, in the 2012 election, Florida, with its close popular vote, received 29 electoral votes, while a comparable victory in Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. This balance allows candidates to address the concerns of both small and large states, ensuring a more equitable representation of the American people.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate secures a majority in the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees the selection of a clear winner. Run-off elections would complicate the presidential election process and may lead to further division among the electorate. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard to ensure a definite outcome and avoid prolonged electoral disputes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It facilitates certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all regions and states, encourages candidates to campaign widely, balances the political power between large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, it is essential to remember that the Electoral College has served us well for over two centuries and maintains the integrity of our elections.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College in making decisions regarding this matter. I am confident that upholding the Electoral College will ensure a fair and representative election process for future generations of Americans.\\n\\nSincerely,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections\\n\\nDear ,\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and advocate against the idea of changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College plays a crucial role in maintaining our democratic process and upholding the principles on which our founding fathers established this nation.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. With the winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and decisive outcome. As witnessed in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. This system minimizes the likelihood of a disputed election and provides a stable framework for the American people.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This forces candidates to campaign across the nation, appealing to voters from different backgrounds and perspectives. It ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to win the presidency and that all Americans feel represented in the highest office.\\n\\nFurthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This system gives a voice to the most thoughtful voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and neglecting the concerns and issues of smaller states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also balances the political power between large and small states. The system restores weight to large states that may otherwise lose their influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. For instance, in the 2012 election, Florida, with its close popular vote, received 29 electoral votes, while a comparable victory in Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. This balance allows candidates to address the concerns of both small and large states, ensuring a more equitable representation of the American people.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate secures a majority in the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees the selection of a clear winner. Run-off elections would complicate the presidential election process and may lead to further division among the electorate. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard to ensure a definite outcome and avoid prolonged electoral disputes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It facilitates certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all regions and states, encourages candidates to campaign widely, balances the political power between large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, it is essential to remember that the Electoral College has served us well for over two centuries and maintains the integrity of our elections.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College in making decisions regarding this matter. I am confident that upholding the Electoral College will ensure a fair and representative election process for future generations of Americans.\\n\\nSincerely,\""

While I understand that there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, I believe that it serves an important purpose in our democracy.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. In fact, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, although possible, is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have broader appeal and address concerns of voters from different regions. By requiring a candidate to have support from various regions, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president, which would likely result in a feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.\\n\\nThe system is also beneficial in focusing campaign efforts on swing states. As mentioned in the text, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on states where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions about their vote. These thoughtful voters, who often receive the most information and attention from the candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives small states an advantage in terms of representation. By allocating electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores some weight to larger states in the political balance. The popularity of a candidate in a large state can influence the outcome of the election to a greater extent than in a small state, ensuring that the concerns of residents in these larger states are not overlooked.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This eliminates the need for further complicated run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters for candidates who have no hope of carrying their state, the fact remains that a significant portion of the eligible population still votes in presidential elections. People participate not because they believe their single vote will swing the entire election, but because they want to express their political preference.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance of power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made, changing to a popular vote system would have its own set of challenges and unintended consequences. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make an informed decision.\\n\\nSincerely,\",\n          \"[Your City, State ZIP Code]\\n[Your Email]\\n\\n\\n[Principal\\u2019s Name]\\n[School Name]\\n[School Address]\\n[City, State ZIP Code]\\n\\nDear [Principal\\u2019s Name],\\n\\nI am writing this letter to express my opinion on the current school cell phone policy that is being reconsidered. After considering both policies, I strongly believe that we should go with Policy 1 - Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.\\n\\nThere are several reasons why Policy 1 would be a better choice for our school. Firstly, with the advancement of technology, smartphones have become an essential tool in our daily lives. They allow us to stay connected with our families and friends, access important information, and use various educational apps and resources that could aid our learning processes. Therefore, allowing students to bring their phones to school would not only provide us with the convenience of staying connected, but it would also enhance our academic performance.\\n\\nSecondly, many emergencies can happen at any time, and having a cell phone readily available could make all the difference in those situations. For example, if something happens during lunch or break periods, students will be able to contact their parents, guardians, or emergency services right away. This will ensure the safety and wellbeing of the students at all times, even outside regular class hours.\\n\\nFinally, it's worth noting that the majority of schools and educational institutions have already implemented similar policies, and it has proven to be effective. These policies have allowed students to use their phones while adhering to certain limitations and guidelines, and it has worked quite well so far. I believe that our school should follow suit and implement Policy 1 as well.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly advocate for the adoption of Policy 1, which allows students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time. I sincerely hope that my opinion and suggestions will be taken into consideration while making the final decision.\\n\\nThank you for your time and attention.\\n\\n[Your signature]\",\n          \"[City, State ZIP]\\n\\n[Phone Number]\\n\\n\\n[Senator's Name]\\n[State Senate Address]\\n[City, State ZIP]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator's Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College as the method of selecting the President of the United States. While there has been a growing call for a change to the system and the adoption of a popular vote, it is my belief that the Electoral College offers several advantages that ensure a fair and balanced outcome in the presidential election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between choosing the President by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. Each state's allotment of electors is based on the number of members in its Congressional delegation. This system ensures that both small and large states have a voice in the election, preserving the principles of federalism and preventing tyranny of the majority.\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. While a dispute over the outcome is possible, such occurrences are far less likely than disputes over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system in most states, a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral vote victory. This certainty of outcome reduces the risk of prolonged election disputes and allows for a smooth and orderly transition of power.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College promotes trans-regional appeal among presidential candidates. Without this system, candidates could focus solely on winning over particular regions and neglect the concerns and interests of other regions of the country. By requiring candidates to have broad support across various regions, the Electoral College ensures that the president has the best interests of all Americans at heart.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to focus campaign efforts on swing states. These states, where the outcome is uncertain, receive increased attention from candidates. This results in a more informed and engaged electorate who carefully consider the candidates and their policies. Swing states represent a diverse range of interests and viewpoints, and their voters should have a say in determining the outcome of the election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also restores some balance to the political weight of large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate based on state population means that large states have less influence than their population size would suggest. By allocating electoral votes based on representation in Congress, the Electoral College gives large states the attention they deserve from candidates, ensuring that their concerns are not overlooked.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, a run-off election would complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, preventing the need for further elections and providing stability and certainty to the American people.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is an integral part of our democratic process and should be retained. It ensures a fair representation of all states, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the political weight of large states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages contribute to a stable and fair presidential election system that upholds the principles of federalism and protects against the tyranny of the majority.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully weigh the benefits of the Electoral College and make decisions that best serve the interests of the American people.\\n\\nSincerely,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

While I understand that some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial safeguard that ensures fair representation and prevents potential crises that could arise from a direct popular vote.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College system was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote. As stated by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process allows for the selection of electors, the meeting where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It consists of 538 electors, with at least 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. This process ensures that each state has a voice in determining the outcome of the election, as the number of electors is based on the state\\u2019s congressional delegation, providing representation for both populous and less populated states (Office of the Federal Register, 1-3).\\n\\nOne of the key benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. In a direct popular vote, disputes over close margins in the popular vote could lead to lengthy legal battles and uncertainty. However, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, minimizing the potential for disputed results (Posner, 18). This stability is critical to maintaining public confidence in the election process.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College promotes the concept of \\u201ceveryone\\u2019s President\\u201d by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country holds enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the nation and address the needs and concerns of diverse regions. In this way, the system ensures that the elected president has a broad understanding of the nation's interests and does not simply cater to one particular region (Posner, 19).\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College\\u2019s focus on swing states allows for more thoughtful and engaged voters. As mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner, swing states receive more attention from candidates, leading voters in these states to pay closer attention to campaign messages. These voters are more likely to listen and evaluate the candidates' positions, resulting in well-informed decisions (Posner, 20). This ensures that states with a variety of political perspectives have an opportunity to shape the outcome of the election.\\n\\nIn relation to the concern about big states potentially dominating the election process, the Electoral College helps balance the political weight between large and small states. It allows large states to have greater influence while preventing certain regions from being disproportionately powerful. The electoral votes are proportionate to each state's population, ensuring that candidates give due consideration to both large and small states during their campaigns (Posner, 21).\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College method avoids run-off elections that could complicate and prolong the presidential election process. It eliminates the need for additional votes or run-off elections when no candidate secures an absolute majority. This streamlined process promotes continuity and efficiency in determining the president-elect (Posner, 22).\\n\\nWhile some critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in non-competitive states from voting, statistics show that approximately half of eligible Americans still participate in presidential elections. Voters are motivated by a desire to express their political preference rather than the belief that their single vote will sway the entire election (Posner, 23).\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system stands as a vital component of our democratic process. It ensures that every state has a voice in electing the President, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids potential run-off elections. The Electoral College is a time-tested system that has provided stability and fairness to the presidential election process for over two centuries.\\n\\nTherefore, I urge you to consider the importance of retaining the Electoral College and to vote in favor of maintaining this crucial institution.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\",\n          \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI strongly believe that our school should engage in community service to make a positive impact on our local environment and support those in need. As students, it is our responsibility to give back to our community and help clean up our streets, parks, and public spaces. In addition to this, I think it would be beneficial for us to volunteer our time to help with animal care and provide food and assistance to those who are struggling with hunger.\\n\\nAs a society, we have a responsibility to protect our planet and ensure that it remains a safe and healthy place for future generations. By participating in community service, we can work together to reduce litter and pollution, and promote sustainable practices that will help preserve our environment.\\n\\nFurthermore, helping out those in need is not only a moral obligation, but also a great way to give back to our community. By donating to local charities and volunteering our time, we can make a real difference in the lives of those who are struggling with hunger and homelessness.\\n\\nIn addition to this, I think it would be a great idea for our school to organize a winter clothing drive to help those in need during the colder months. This would not only provide warmth and comfort to those in need, but also promote a sense of community and generosity among our students.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that community service is an important aspect of our education and a crucial part of being a responsible member of society. By engaging in community service, we can make a positive impact on our local environment and help those in need, while also learning valuable skills and building strong connections with our community.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[STUDENT\\\\_NAME]\",\n          \"Exploring Career Opportunities in Landscape Design and Business Management\\n\\nDear [Teacher's Name],\\n\\nAs I research different careers, I find myself drawn to two fields that offer a wealth of opportunities: Landscape Design and Business Management. These fields not only provide a stable income, but they also allow individuals to express their creativity and make a positive impact on their communities. In this essay, I will explain the opportunities that exist in each field, identify resources to aid in convincing others, and analyze the potential criticisms of opportunity work.\\n\\nLandscape Design is a field that combines art and nature to create beautiful and functional outdoor spaces. As a landscape designer, I would have the opportunity to work on projects such as designing gardens, parks, and other outdoor areas. This field requires a strong understanding of plants, soil, and water, as well as an eye for aesthetics. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for landscape designers is around $50,000, with the highest paid professionals earning over $90,000.\\n\\nTo convince others of the opportunities in Landscape Design, I would use resources such as fliers, business cards, and books. For example, I could create a flier that showcases the benefits of working in this field, including the potential for creativity, stability, and financial success. I could also provide examples of successful landscape designers and their work, highlighting the positive impact they have had on their communities.\\n\\nBusiness Management, on the other hand, involves overseeing and managing businesses, organizations, and events. As a business manager, I would have the opportunity to work in a variety of industries, from healthcare to technology. This field requires strong leadership and organizational skills, as well as an understanding of financial management and marketing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for business managers is around $100,000, with the highest paid professionals earning over $200,000.\\n\\nTo convince others of the opportunities in Business Management, I would use similar resources as those mentioned above. For example, I could create a business card that highlights my skills and experience in\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As a student in 9th grade, I have been learning about this system and its effects on our democracy, and I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In winner-takes-all states, it is much harder to manipulate the results of an election. With a popular vote system, a candidate could potentially win the presidency with only a few percentage points more than their opponent, leading to disputes and recounts that could drag on for weeks or even months. The Electoral College, on the other hand, makes it much more difficult for a candidate to win without a clear majority of electoral votes. This is beneficial for the stability and legitimacy of our political system.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College requires candidates to have broad, transregional appeal. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must secure a diverse coalition of voters across the country. This forces them to consider the needs and concerns of many different groups, rather than just focusing on a few swing states. This can lead to more inclusive and representative policies, as the candidate must appeal to a wider range of people.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also focuses attention on swing states. While this may seem unfair to those who live in states that are already solidly Democrat or Republican, it actually benefits those who live in swing states. Candidates are forced to spend time and resources campaigning in these states, listening to the concerns of their residents and addressing their issues. This leads to a more engaged and informed electorate, which is crucial for a healthy democracy.\\n\\nBalancing the influence of large states is another advantage of the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus most of their attention on the largest and most populous states, such as California and New York. This would leave smaller states feeling ignored and marginalized. The Electoral College helps to ensure that all states have a say in the election, regardless of their size.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In a popular vote system, it is possible for a third-party candidate to siphon off enough votes to prevent either major-party candidate from winning a majority. This would lead to a run-off election, which would be expensive and time-consuming. The Electoral College eliminates this possibility, as it is rare for a third-party candidate to win any electoral votes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place. While it is not a perfect system, it is superior to a popular vote system in many ways. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires broad appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions about the future of our electoral system.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\",\n          \"[Grade 7]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Mrs. ,\\n\\nI am writing this letter to share my thoughts about the school\\u2019s cell phone policy. I appreciate the effort you have taken to reconsider it. However, I firmly believe that allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during free periods is the best policy. I am writing this letter to convince you why this policy is better than the other.\\n\\nFirstly, allowing students to bring their phones will increase their responsibility. It will teach them how to use their phones wisely and in the right way. It can also help them to manage their time between studying and using their phones. If we are allowed to use our phones during break time, we will be able to connect with our families and friends easily. Moreover, we can use our phones for educational purposes, to access the internet or to use educational apps.\\n\\nSecondly, in case of emergencies, it will be very helpful to have phones with us. We can contact our parents or guardians in case of any emergency without having to borrow anyone's phone.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if the school implements a \\\"No phones\\\" policy, it will be inconvenient for many students. It may also create a feeling of frustration and anger. In addition, some students may have medical conditions that require them to have a phone at all times.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I would like to request you to please consider my thoughts about the cell phone policy at our school. I believe that allowing students to bring their phones to school will be beneficial for everyone. Thank you for considering my request.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\",\n          \"Dear ,\\n\\nAs a citizen of [State], I am writing to you to express my opinion on the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place because it has been an integral part of our election process since the founding of our country. The system provides protection for the interests of smaller states and guarantees that every vote counts.\\n\\nThe Electoral College ensures that every vote has an equal value, regardless of where the voter resides. It also helps to prevent the election from being dominated by large cities and populous states. In a direct election, where the candidate who receives the most votes wins, candidates may focus only on the needs of the largest cities and most populous states, ignoring the needs of smaller states and rural communities.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate has a broad base of support across the country. The winner must win the majority of electoral votes, which are awarded based on the popular vote in each state. This system prevents regional candidates from winning the election and ensures that the president-elect has broad support from across the country.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College is outdated, the system has evolved to reflect the changing demographics of our country. The number of electors each state receives is based on its population, ensuring that every state has a say in the election process. Additionally, the Electoral College has been reformed to reflect the changing political landscape, with many states adopting a winner-takes-all approach to allocating their electoral votes.\\n\\nCritics argue that the Electoral College has the potential to cause confusion and may lead to faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes, which could throw the election to Congress. However, these concerns are largely unfounded, as there have been only a few instances in which faithless electors have cast votes for someone other than the person who won the popular vote in their state. Furthermore, a tie in electoral votes is an extremely rare occurrence that is unlikely to happen in the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I urge you to support the Electoral College and resist calls to replace it with a system of direct election. The Electoral College has been an integral part of our election process for over 200 years and has proven to be an effective way to ensure that every vote counts and that the winning candidate has broad support across the country.

I understand that you want us to focus on our studies, but I think this policy is not fair because it will discourage many students.\\n\\nFirstly, not every student is good at all subjects. It is unfair to punish a student who is good at sports or other activities because of their grades in other classes that might not be their strengths. For example, a student may be an excellent athlete and have an A or B in Physical Education but struggle with Math and Science, resulting in a grade C. This does not mean they should not be allowed to participate in sports or other activities, as it may be their passion and a way to relieve stress.\\n\\nSecondly, sports and activities can also help improve our grades. Being part of a team or club can help us learn time management skills, which can help us balance our academic studies better. It can also give us an incentive to do well academically, as we will want to keep playing or participating in activities we are passionate about.\\n\\nFinally, this policy will also hurt students who are involved in sports or other activities as it may lead to them losing interest in school. If students cannot participate in sports or other activities, they may feel disconnected from school and may not see the point of attending, which can result in poor grades.\\n\\nI hope that you will consider these points when deciding whether to enforce this policy or not. It will have a big impact on our school community, and I hope that you will make the right decision for us. Thank you for your consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n'"

              "'Single-use plastics have been a major issue for our environment and oceans. Plastics such as bags, straws, and water bottles are used once and then discarded, often ending up in the ocean or in landfills. This has led to the suffering of marine life and birds who mistake the plastic as food and eat it which causes harm to their bodies.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why single-use plastics should be banned is that they are not biodegradable. This means that they will not break down naturally in the environment and will remain there for hundreds of years. For example, plastic bags can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. This is a major problem because it means that the plastic waste that we produce today will still be here in the future, polluting our planet.\\n\\nAnother reason to ban single-use plastics is that they are not recyclable. Many people think that recycling is the solution to the plastic problem, but the truth is that most plastics cannot be recycled. For example, plastic bags and straws are rarely recycled and often end up in the ocean. This means that even if we do recycle, the majority of plastic waste will still end up in the environment.\\n\\nFurthermore, the production of single-use plastics requires the use of fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change. The extraction and transportation of these fuels also harm the environment. For example, the production of plastic bags requires the use of natural gas and petroleum, which are fossil fuels. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce our reliance on these fuels and decrease our carbon footprint.\\n\\nIn addition, the use of single-use plastics is not necessary. There are many alternatives that are reusable and environmentally friendly. For example, reusable bags, stainless steel straws, and refillable water bottles. These alternatives are not only better for the environment, but they are also cost-effective.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect our environment. They are not biodegradable, not recyclable, and their production contributes to climate change. There are many alternatives that are reusable and environmentally friendly. We must take action now to reduce our plastic waste and protect our planet for future generations.'"

So, you know how sometimes you're trying to decide on something, like what movie to watch or what game to play, and you're just not sure what to do? That's where talking to multiple people comes in! \\n\\nTalking to more than one person can help you get multiple opinions and ideas, which can totally change the way you think about something. Like, if you're trying to decide on a new restaurant to try, asking your friends who live in the area can give you way more options than just asking your parents. And, if you're trying to decide on a new video game to play, asking your friends who are also gamers can give you some awesome recommendations. \\n\\nBut, it's not just about getting more ideas. Talking to multiple people can also help you learn new things! When you're discussing something with someone else, you can learn about their perspective and experiences, which can totally broaden your horizons. Like, if you're trying to learn a new language, talking to native speakers can help you pick up on things you wouldn't have noticed otherwise. \\n\\nAnd, let's not forget about getting help when you need it! If you're trying to solve a problem or make a decision, talking to multiple people can give you different viewpoints and insights that can totally help you figure things out. Like, if you're trying to decide on a college major, talking to people who are already in that field can give you some super helpful advice. \\n\\nOkay, so here's an example to illustrate my point. Last year, I was trying to decide on a new hobby, and I asked my friends what they thought. They recommended painting, and I was like, \\\"Uh, I'm not really good at art.\\\" But, they convinced me to give it a try, and now I'm totally hooked!  It's so much fun, and I've learned so much from my friends who are also into it. \\n\\nSo, there you have it! Talking to more than one person can totally help you make better choices, learn new things, and get help when you\",\n          \"Taking online or video conferencing classes can be a convenient option for students, as they can attend class from the comfort of their own home and at a time that suits them best. However, despite these advantages, I believe that online classes are not the best option for students.\\n\\nFirstly, online classes can be very boring for students. Without the face-to-face interaction and engagement of a traditional classroom setting, students may struggle to stay focused and motivated. For example, if a teacher's delivery is monotonous or if the content is not engaging, students may find themselves drifting off and missing important information. This can lead to a lack of understanding and a lack of progress in their learning.\\n\\nSecondly, online classes can be challenging for students to understand. Without the visual cues and hands-on activities of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to grasp complex concepts. For example, if a teacher is delivering a lecture via video, students may not be able to ask questions or seek clarification in real-time. This can lead to confusion and a lack of understanding. Additionally, if a student's young ones are at home while they are trying to listen to the teaching, they may be distracted and not able to focus on the material.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while online classes may seem like a convenient option, I believe that they are not the best option for students. The lack of engagement and understanding can make it difficult for students to gain any meaningful learning from the experience. I would recommend that students consider taking traditional classes or finding other forms of learning that are more engaging and interactive.\",\n          \"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for the environment. The passages provided highlight the benefits of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days, all of which contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.\\n\\nCar-free communities, such as Vauban in Germany, offer a model for a more sustainable way of living. These communities prioritize walking, cycling, and public transportation, and discourage car ownership. The passage states that 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have experienced improved quality of life and reduced stress levels without cars. This suggests that limiting car usage can lead to a more peaceful and enjoyable community.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passages highlight how driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris, can significantly reduce congestion. In Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent after the ban was enforced. This reduction in traffic congestion not only improves air quality but also saves time for commuters. With fewer cars on the road, public transportation becomes more efficient, allowing for faster travel times and a smoother flow of traffic.\\n\\nIn addition to these benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more active communities. Car-free days, such as the one in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transportation. These alternative modes of transportation promote physical activity, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The passage mentions how millions of Colombians participated in the car-free day and left the streets devoid of traffic jams. This shows that there is a willingness among people to embrace alternative modes of transportation and prioritize their health.\\n\\nOverall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved quality of life, reduced traffic congestion, and healthier communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success and feasibility of implementing car-free initiatives. As a society, it is important to prioritize sustainable transportation options and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They would totally change the game, man! No more having to sit behind the wheel and deal with all the stress of driving. You could just sit back and relax or even work while you're commuting. And think of all the accidents that could be prevented! The author of that article definitely makes a good point about how having more driverless cars on the road could help reduce traffic congestion too.\\n\\nBut then again, the author also talks about how driverless cars might not be ready for prime time just yet. There are still some technical issues that need to be worked out before they can be safely introduced into mainstream society. Also, lots of people could lose their jobs because of these cars -- think about all the drivers who would be out of work if most people started using driverless cars. That's a whole population of people who could be put out on the street and forced to find new jobs.\\n\\nI guess the truth is that there are both pros and cons to the introduction of driverless cars. While I think the pros could potentially outweigh the cons if the technology could be perfected, there are still questions about how these cars would impact society as a whole if they were to suddenly become ubiquitous. I guess only time will tell if we will one day all be riding around in driverless cars. As much as I personally would welcome the change, I think that there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue.\",\n          \"The Development of Driverless Cars\\n\\nWhile the introduction of driverless cars presents some appealing benefits, there are also significant risks that must be addressed before fully embracing their development. According to the article \\\"Driverless Cars are Coming,\\\" autonomous vehicles could help reduce traffic accidents and make transportation more accessible. However, the technology also introduces new safety and privacy concerns that require careful consideration.  \\n\\nOn the one hand, removing human error from the driving equation could potentially save thousands of lives each year. The article notes that human behavior like distracted driving, drunk driving, and simple mistakes cause over 90% of traffic collisions. By removing fallible human judgement from vehicle operation, driverless cars may cut down on accidents. They could also improve mobility for the elderly and disabled by providing an independent way to travel. \\n\\nHowever, the technology also raises serious safety and privacy issues. Fully autonomous vehicles will rely on advanced sensors, software and artificial intelligence to navigate roads\\u2014but errors could potentially occur within these complex systems. While manufacturers aim to make the technology safer than human drivers, the possibility of software or sensor malfunctions jeopardizing lives is concerning. Additionally, gathering and storing massive amounts of personal data through vehicle use introduces new privacy risks. If hackers or governments access navigation records, they could track detailed movements over time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while driverless cars offer encouraging possibilities, fully embracing their development may be premature given outstanding technological and privacy issues. More research and safeguards are needed to assure autonomous vehicles are at least as safe as -- if not safer than -- human-operated cars. Laws and regulations should also strictly protect any data collected through use. Overall, autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform transportation for the better if developers adequately address concerns over safety and personal privacy as the technology advances. A prudent, cautious approach balancing benefits and risks seems wisest.\",\n          \"The Electoral College system has long been a topic of debate, with many advocating for its modification or outright removal due to numerous concerns over its perceived fairness and efficiency. However, it's important to analyze and evaluate the purpose of the Electoral College in determining the outcome of presidential elections, before delving into the arguments regarding its usefulness or limitations.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was established in the US Constitution by the Founding Fathers and is a method used to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. It is essentially an indirect, elector-based process where designated electors cast their vote, reflecting the will of their state's voters. Each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia receive a number of electors equal to the sum of their congressional representatives. These electors then convene on Electoral College Day (the first Monday following the second Wednesday in December) to cast their ballots. Regardless of the popular vote, the candidate who secures a majority of the electoral votes becomes the President or Vice President. \\n\\nDespite its intentions to create a balanced and inclusive system, several critics argue that the Electoral College is fundamentally flawed, primarily because of the disproportionate influence it gives to less-populous states relative to larger ones, particularly in the context of current population sizes. In more recent times, this has resulted in certain outcomes where a candidate might lose the popular vote but still win the election due to strong performances in certain states with a larger number of electors relative to their population. This can be seen in various instances, such as in 2000 when George W. Bush secured defeat of Al Gore in the electoral count despite losing the popular vote, or in 2016 with Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton after receiving more election-year votes.\\n\\nCritics also highlight potential for abuse in the Electoral College system. By altering a few electoral votes, or even engaging in corrupt practices and coercion during the selection process, significant impacts on the results could be achieved. The concentration of electoral power in relatively few swing states could exacerbate this issue and undermine the integrity of the electoral process, as has been argued in cases such as the contested 2000 election and more recent instances in 2016.\\n\\nAnother downside can be the lack of direct representative connection between the President and Vice President and the general population they serve. The Electoral College operates more akin to a separate parliamentary system rather than a direct democracy, which some observers argue might lead to disengaged citizens less inclined to participate in political activities due to a perceived disconnection from the electoral process.\\n\\nDespite these criticisms, others argue in defense of the Electoral College based on specific benefits and aims of the system. The main argument, as stated by proponents, is that the Electoral College provides a form of \\\"geographical representation\\\" where not just the national totals but the will of the individual states is accurately reflected during elections. As voting is decentralized to state and local levels, the chances of a national 'bandwagon effect' are minimized, which may lead to more diverse political representation within the government.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College fosters an atmosphere of fairness and checks and balances, ensuring that each state -- regardless of its relative size or population -- has some stake in the outcome of each presidential election. This structure helps to promote a sense of national unity and cooperation, fostering a dynamic political environment with interplay between local and national interests, which is essential to maintain a healthy democratic balance.\\n\\nWhile the Electoral College does indeed have shortcomings and can be considered outdated in many ways, it's crucial to recognize its foundational purpose within the broader context of US constitutional principles. As evidenced by its enduring presence in the American political landscape, the Electoral College remains central to several key issues, such as democratic representation and the distribution of political power amongst all states. In this respect, the electoral system is instrumental in safeguarding the principles enshrined in the US Constitution, even if the approach may seem unorthodox in a modern democratic era. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the utility and effectiveness of the Electoral College in determining presidential elections have often been controversial. Advocates for its reform or removal argue that it unfairly disregards the national popular vote, incentivizes corruption, and leads to an unbalanced system, whereas proponents of the Electoral College argue that it helps to ensure that individual states and smaller groups play a role in the political process while preserving a degree of balance between the federal government and the states. Regardless of differing perspectives, it's vital to recognize the historical context and fundamental role of the Electoral College in fostering a balanced, interconnected US political system. Whether its eventual fate lies in further reform, or even scrapping entirely, remains to be seen, but for now, its presence remains a defining feature of America's presidential electoral process.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Today, we\\'re going to talk about two very important operations - multiplying and dividing. We use multiplying and dividing to do calculations quickly and solve problems in the real world. \\n\\nLet\\'s use an example to show how multiplying and dividing is faster than using adding and subtracting. Imagine that you have 10 apples and want to give them all to your friends. With adding and subtracting, you\\'d need to find the total of how many apples you have, and then take that total and divide it by 10 to figure out how much each friend will get. That\\'s a lot of work!\\n\\nBut with multiplying and dividing, you can solve the problem much faster. You can just divide 10 by the number of friends you have  let\\'s say three friends here. That means you can say \"each friend will get three apples\" without doing any adding or subtracting!\\n\\nSo, as you can see, using multiplying and dividing can be a great way to solve problems quickly and efficiently  so let\\'s get to it and start learning!'"

They help break down food, clean our environment, and even help us digest certain foods! \\ud83e\\udd2f\\n\\nFor our science fair project, we could research the different types of bacteria and their functions. We could even experiment with different ways to cultivate and study them! \\ud83d\\udd2c We could look at how bacteria affect the environment, like how they help decompose organic matter or how they can be used to clean up pollution. \\ud83c\\udf31\\ud83c\\udf3f\\n\\nAnother cool thing about bacteria is that they can be used to create different products, like food, medicine, and even fuels! \\ud83c\\udf54\\ud83d\\udc8a\\ud83d\\udd0b Imagine being able to create food that's not only delicious but also good for you, or medicine that can cure diseases without harmful side effects! \\ud83e\\udd14\\n\\nSo, why should you choose bacteria as your science fair project? Well, for starters, it's a topic that's relevant to our everyday lives, and it's something that most people don't know much about. \\ud83e\\udd37\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f By learning more about bacteria, we can gain a better understanding of how our world works and how we can improve it. \\ud83c\\udf0e\\n\\nPlus, bacteria are super tiny, so it's easy to study them using simple equipment like petri dishes and microscopes! \\ud83d\\udd0d\\ud83d\\udd2c And, who knows, you might even discover something new and exciting about bacteria that no one else knows! \\ud83d\\udca1\\n\\nSo, there you have it! \\ud83e\\udd13\",\n          \"Sure, I'd be happy to write an essay about Busch Gardens! \\ud83c\\udfa2\\ud83c\\udfa2\\ud83c\\udfa2\\n\\nSo, Busch Gardens is this super cool theme park in Tampa, Florida. It's like, really big and has lots of stuff to do! \\ud83d\\ude0d There are so many rides, shops, games, and mazes that my family would totally love. \\ud83e\\udd29\\n\\nFirst of all, let's talk about the rides. Busch Gardens has like, a million of them! \\ud83d\\ude05 My little brother would totally freak out over the roller coasters and stuff like that. There's this one called the SheiKra that spins you around so fast, it's like you're on a crazy roller coaster adventure! \\ud83c\\udfa2 And my mom would love the Kumba, which is like, this super fast roller coaster that goes upside down! \\ud83d\\ude32\\n\\nBut it's not just about the roller coasters, there are also these really cool water rides. My dad would totally dig the Montu, which is like, this water roller coaster that goes through these really cool tunnels and stuff. And my sister would love the Jungala, which is like, this super fun water play area with these really cool slides and stuff. \\ud83c\\udfca\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f\\ud83c\\udf34\\n\\nAnd let's not forget about the shops! Busch Gardens has like, a million of them! \\ud83d\\udecd\\ufe0f My mom would totally love the Cheetah Chest, which is like, this super cool shop with all these really cool cheetah-themed stuff. And my sister would love the Serengeti Overlook, which is like, this really cool shop with all these really cool animal-themed stuff. \\ud83d\\udc06\\ud83e\\udd81\\n\\nBut the best part is, there are also these really cool games and mazes! My brother would totally love the Serengeti Scramble, which is like, this super fun game where you have to find all these really cool animals. And my mom would love the Jungala Jumble, which is like, this really cool maze\",\n          \"Sure, here's my essay response:\\n\\nHey, so like, I know some people think it's a good idea for students to be able to bring their phones to school. But honestly, I don't think it's a super good idea. I mean, there are definitely some pros to it, like being able to look up stuff for class or check the time during breaks. But there are also some pretty big cons.\\n\\nOne of the main pros is that it can be really helpful for learning. Like, if you're in a history class and you're trying to remember some dates or events, you can just pull out your phone and look them up real quick. Or if you're in math and you need to check a formula, you can do that too. It's like, really convenient.\\n\\nBut there are also some cons. Like, if you're in class and you're on your phone all the time, you're not really paying attention to what the teacher is saying. And if you're texting or whatever during class, you could get in trouble. Or like, if you're in a group project and you need to work together, it's hard to do that if everyone's on their phone.\\n\\nAnother con is that it can be really distracting. Like, if you're in class and you see something funny on your phone, you might get distracted and not pay attention to the lesson. Or if you're texting with your friends during class, you might miss something important. It's like, really easy to get distracted.\\n\\nSo, overall, I don't think it's a good idea for students to be able to bring their phones to school. It's just too easy to get distracted and not pay attention to what's going on in class. And even though it might be helpful sometimes, it's not worth the distractions. I mean, we're in school to learn, not to be on our phones all the time.\\n\\nI hope that makes sense!

So, you know how sometimes you're trying to decide on something, like what movie to watch or what game to play, and you're just not sure what to do? That's where talking to multiple people comes in! \\n\\nTalking to more than one person can help you get multiple opinions and ideas, which can totally change the way you think about something. Like, if you're trying to decide on a new restaurant to try, asking your friends who live in the area can give you way more options than just asking your parents. And, if you're trying to decide on a new video game to play, asking your friends who are also gamers can give you some awesome recommendations. \\n\\nBut, it's not just about getting more ideas. Talking to multiple people can also help you learn new things! When you're discussing something with someone else, you can learn about their perspective and experiences, which can totally broaden your horizons. Like, if you're trying to learn a new language, talking to native speakers can help you pick up on things you wouldn't have noticed otherwise. \\n\\nAnd, let's not forget about getting help when you need it! If you're trying to solve a problem or make a decision, talking to multiple people can give you different viewpoints and insights that can totally help you figure things out. Like, if you're trying to decide on a college major, talking to people who are already in that field can give you some super helpful advice. \\n\\nOkay, so here's an example to illustrate my point. Last year, I was trying to decide on a new hobby, and I asked my friends what they thought. They recommended painting, and I was like, \\\"Uh, I'm not really good at art.\\\" But, they convinced me to give it a try, and now I'm totally hooked!  It's so much fun, and I've learned so much from my friends who are also into it. \\n\\nSo, there you have it! Talking to more than one person can totally help you make better choices, learn new things, and get help when you\",\n          \"Taking online or video conferencing classes can be a convenient option for students, as they can attend class from the comfort of their own home and at a time that suits them best. However, despite these advantages, I believe that online classes are not the best option for students.\\n\\nFirstly, online classes can be very boring for students. Without the face-to-face interaction and engagement of a traditional classroom setting, students may struggle to stay focused and motivated. For example, if a teacher's delivery is monotonous or if the content is not engaging, students may find themselves drifting off and missing important information. This can lead to a lack of understanding and a lack of progress in their learning.\\n\\nSecondly, online classes can be challenging for students to understand. Without the visual cues and hands-on activities of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to grasp complex concepts. For example, if a teacher is delivering a lecture via video, students may not be able to ask questions or seek clarification in real-time. This can lead to confusion and a lack of understanding. Additionally, if a student's young ones are at home while they are trying to listen to the teaching, they may be distracted and not able to focus on the material.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while online classes may seem like a convenient option, I believe that they are not the best option for students. The lack of engagement and understanding can make it difficult for students to gain any meaningful learning from the experience. I would recommend that students consider taking traditional classes or finding other forms of learning that are more engaging and interactive.\",\n          \"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for the environment. The passages provided highlight the benefits of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days, all of which contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.\\n\\nCar-free communities, such as Vauban in Germany, offer a model for a more sustainable way of living. These communities prioritize walking, cycling, and public transportation, and discourage car ownership. The passage states that 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have experienced improved quality of life and reduced stress levels without cars. This suggests that limiting car usage can lead to a more peaceful and enjoyable community.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passages highlight how driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris, can significantly reduce congestion. In Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent after the ban was enforced. This reduction in traffic congestion not only improves air quality but also saves time for commuters. With fewer cars on the road, public transportation becomes more efficient, allowing for faster travel times and a smoother flow of traffic.\\n\\nIn addition to these benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more active communities. Car-free days, such as the one in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transportation. These alternative modes of transportation promote physical activity, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The passage mentions how millions of Colombians participated in the car-free day and left the streets devoid of traffic jams. This shows that there is a willingness among people to embrace alternative modes of transportation and prioritize their health.\\n\\nOverall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved quality of life, reduced traffic congestion, and healthier communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success and feasibility of implementing car-free initiatives. As a society, it is important to prioritize sustainable transportation options and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'an online learning environment.\\n\\nDistance/online learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. While there are certainly advantages and disadvantages to this type of education, it is clear that it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for students around the world who cannot access a physical school.\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the flexibility it offers. Students can learn at their own pace, on their own schedule, and from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly important for students who live in remote areas or have other obligations that make it difficult to attend traditional school. In addition, distance learning can be more affordable than traditional schooling, as students do not have to pay for transportation, housing, or other expenses associated with attending a physical school.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to distance learning. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of social interaction. Young people in particular often rely on their peers for social support and friendship, and this can be difficult to maintain when learning online. In addition, students may struggle with staying motivated and disciplined, as they do not have the same level of structure and accountability that they would in a physical school.\\n\\nOne example of a student who had to learn via distance learning is a young girl named Sarah. Sarah lived in a small village in a remote area of Africa, where there was no school within walking distance. She was determined to get an education, but it was difficult to find a school that could accommodate her needs. Eventually, Sarah was able to enroll in an online school, which allowed her to learn from anywhere with an internet connection. While she faced some challenges, such as limited access to technology and a lack of social interaction, Sarah was able to overcome these obstacles and graduate with honors.\\n\\nThe effects of distance/online learning on social skills can be significant, particularly for young people. In a physical school, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers on a daily basis, which can help them develop important social skills such as communication, cooperation, and empathy. In an online learning environment, students may have less opportunities for social interaction, which can make it difficult to develop these skills. However, there are ways to mitigate this issue, such as through virtual group projects and online discussion forums.\\n\\nWhen comparing and contrasting the experiences of students who learn in a physical school vs an online learning environment, it'"

Many scientists have proven to us that cellphones put drivers at a very great risk of getting into a wreck. Even with this information drivers still choose to use there phone behind the wheel. Drivers have even resulted to using hand free devices, because they think that this is safer. Some people use the excuse that \\\"If there's an emergency they may need there cellular device\\\" to support the face of using their phone behind the wheel. There's a lot of evidence to support why drivers should not use their phone behind the wheel.\\n\\nWhen driving it's very hard to focus on both the road and your phone. It's very easy to forget that your sharing the road with other people. Other people on take notice to drivers being on the cellular devices even if they don't want to or not because of the hazards they create. Texting while driving is the more dangerous than talking while driving. You take your eyes off the road for one minute and boom you've gotten into a wreck.\\n\\nMost of the drivers that fall into this category are teens. These drivers have the highest fatalities behind the wheel due to using a phone. In the state of Utah using your phone behind the wheel , and you cause an accident it can land you in jail for up to 15 years. Most teens use airpods made by Apple inc, instead of holding the phone in there hand. This is even more dangerous because you can't hear your surroundings.\\n\\nIn  if people continue to use there cellular devices behind the wheel he number of casualties on the roads they will continue to increase.. It is the people's responsibility to not put their own and others people lives at risk due to there horrible actions.\",\n          \"We use them everyday, they get us to our destinations, but what would life be without them? What benefits could arise from limiting the usage of cars? According to source 1, \\\"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\\\" source 2, \\\"Paris bans driving due to smog,\\\" source 3, \\\"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\\\" and source 4, \\\"The End of Car Culture,\\\" limiting the usage of cars has gained advantages towards traffic, pollution, and the overall community to better benefit the environment.\\n\\nIn source 1, \\\"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\\\" residents of the \\\"upscale community\\\" of Vauban, Germany, have become \\\"suburban pioneers\\\" and \\\"have given up their cars.\\\" Although in many cities around the world it is unimaginable to give up your cars, it has become increasingly beneficial towards the environment and community. It is said to be \\\"a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes,\\\" as cars are responsible for \\\"12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\\\" Planners are now taking the concept to \\\"suburbs\\\" where \\\"stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways,\\\" thus making the car-banning residential friendly, and environmentally helpful. Not only will the limiting usage of cars be beneficial towards the community, it will also be beneficial towards your mental health as said by Heidrun Walter who stated \\\"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\\\"\\n\\nIn source 2, \\\"Paris bans driving due to smog,\\\" residents of Paris are also seeing increasing advantages \\\"after days of near-record pollution\\\" when Paris \\\"enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\\\" within \\\"five-days of intensifying smog,\\\" \\\"congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France.\\\" If five-days can have a significant beneficial impact, imagine what a month can do, or a year, or even a decade towards the restoration of the environment.\\n\\nSimilar to the previous cities in the sources mentioned, Bogota also participates in a \\\"car-free day\\\" as stated in source 3, \\\"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\\\" where \\\"millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work,\\\" \\\"leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\\\" In this \\\"Day Without Cars\\\" campaign, \\\"the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,\\\" and its goal is being reached. By banning the usage of cars \\\"it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\\\" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaze. Along with many other advantages such as the \\\"blooming\\\" of \\\"parks and sports centers\\\" \\\"throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,\\\" as stated in the article.\\n\\nLast but not least, in source 4, \\\"The End of Car Culture,\\\" \\\"recent studies\\\" have shown that \\\"Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by,\\\" and \\\"if this pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment.\\\" With a decreasing amount of citizens driving, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, has \\\"led out a buisness plan\\\" that will \\\"create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\\\" The decreased usage of cars will have an everlasting positive impact on the environment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although living in a world free of cars is a world many of us can never dream of, it has shown to lead to significant advantages towards traffic, pollution, and the overall community, which can be seen in the cities; Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, Bogota, Columbia and the United States  as stated in the sources \\\"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\\\" \\\"Paris bans driving due to smog,\\\" \\\"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\\\" and \\\"The End of Car Culture.\\\" Many of us should no longer dread the banning of cars, but anticipate it.\",\n          \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nOver the past decade, technology has been deeply integrated into our lives to the point where we couldn't live without it. One of those technologies is our phones. Phones are constantly being used; from texting and talking to watching movies and playing games. People are constantly using them and it seems like you can't go anywhere without your phone. Because of this, there's been a dramatic rise in car accidents caused by phone distractions. States have passed laws banning cell phone use while driving, however, this really hasn't achieved much.\\n\\nThere are still many people looking down at their laps instead of looking at the road. Phones are helpful while driving for things like navigation or music, but drivers shouldn't be checking their social media or texting while driving. This diverts their focus from what's happening on the road, leading to an accident. While driving, drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones.\\n\\nIn the United States alone nearly 390,000 car accidents occur each year due to drivers being on their phones. \\\"1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.\\\"(Snyder). A survey done by CBS News found that \\\"98 percent of motorists who own cellphones and text regularly said that they were aware of the dangers, yet three-quarters of them admitted to texting while driving...\\\"(Ap, 1). So even though most people are aware of the dangers, why do they continue you to use their phones while driving? According to the same CBS article, most of the people who do use their phones believe they're good multi-taskers. In the article, they said, \\\"drivers believed they can \\\"easily do several things at once, even while driving\\\".\\\"(Ap, 3). Most of these drivers honestly believe that they are competent enough to use their phones while driving but despite all their confidence, texting while driving is still \\\"6 times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving\\\"(Snyder, 1). In a survey conducted in 2014 about 28% of the people surveyed said, \\\"they are worried about missing out of something important if they don't check their phones right away.\\\"(Ap, 9). Another group, \\\"believed that others expect them to respond to texts \\\"right away\\\".\\\"(Ap, 10). And a small percentage believed that they are, \\\"addicted to texting\\\"(Ap, 11). For most of these people, it seems almost impossible for them to put their phones down for even a second. The constant use and over-reliance on phones have caused them to become very dependent on them. That means even while driving they are focusing on what's happening in the digital world on their phones, and not on the road they are driving on.\\n\\nThere are studies out there that say that banning cell phone use while driving has more positive effects than negative and that there are many benefits for allowing its use on the road. A study done by Harvard University found that using cell phones while driving, \\\"Decreased emergency response times/improved life-saving outcomes\\\"(Ropeik,3). This is a common argument habitual cell phone users make. They say that they will be able to report an emergency or accident faster if they have their cell phones already in their hands, but the truth is that they are the ones that will probably cause that accident. Another argument made is, \\\"I was at a stoplight!\\\" (Schule, 5). This is one of the most common excuses made by drivers caught using their phones. They believe if they're stopped that they aren't a danger, however, this isn't the case. A poll done by the Huff Post revealed that 63% of drivers, aged between 18-29, text at red traffic lights. Another statistic showed that, \\\"More than 20 percent of distracted drivers age 15 to 19 involved in fatal crashes were distracted by cell phones...\\\"(\\\"Texting At A Red Light\\\", 4).\\n\\nWhile on the road it is never safe to text, even while at a stoplight. \\\"Stalling to text could lead to rear-end crashes if the other drivers notice the light turn green first.\\\"(\\\"Texting At A Red Light\\\", 5). Almost, \\\"28% of all automobile accidents...\\\"(Ryan, 1), are caused by rear-end collisions.\\n\\nThis is considered one of the largest categories of car accidents in the entire United States. One of the most common causes of rear-ends is distracted driving.\\n\\nMost people believe that they are skilled enough drivers to be able to drive with distractions, but that's just not the case. This ignorance has caused thousands of people to lose their lives every year. You are more likely to die in a car accident than a plane crash, and that's because of how easy it is to be distracted while driving. Imagine a loved one being involved in a fatal accident because a driver was on their phone. It would be devastating. Phones have become such a huge part of our daily lives, and we should be able to utilize them in order to help better them. The bottom line is, they have the potential to cause a lot of damage when they aren't used appropriately and they should not be used while driving.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAp. \\\"Why so Many People Text and Drive, Knowing Dangers.\\\" CBS News, CBS Interactive, 5 Nov. 2014, https://www. cbsnews. com/news/why-so-many-people-text-and-drive-knowing-dangers/. \\\"Governor's Office Of Highway Safety In Georgia.\\\" | Georgia Governor's Office of Highway\\n\\nSafety, 1 July 2018, https://www. gahighwaysafety. org/highway-safety/hands-free-law/.

              "\"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become mandatory in most of our lives. Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways. Driving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family. I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states Arizona, Montana, and Missouri insanely do not have laws against texting while driving. According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives. In conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. I Think you can wait to answer that text.\""

Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. A cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a wreck. People still use cell phones because they want to be available and keep in touch with other people. They think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. They use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. People whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. They can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to an injury.. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people. Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. Hands Free don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. It show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. People have proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man work, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time. People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.\",\n          \"Ever since phones have entered into the world, it has since then become a part of a person's everyday life. With such an important impact that helps what people do in all fields of work, it is no surprise that people use phones wherever they go. Another important inclusion in a person's everyday life is a car, which is also used by people everyday, though cars have proven to be a lot more dangerous than a phone if a person is not paying attention to the road. Many accidents have happened as a result of people not paying attention to the road and this is exactly where a phone comes into play. As previously mentioned, phones are a part of a person's everyday life, and with that much involvement with a phone it often tends to follow people to them while they are driving their car. When people are on their phone while driving, their chances of getting into an accident greatly increase. Though it may seem harmless at first, operating a phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should not be allowed. \\\"Car crashes happen every minute of the day\\\", according to the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA). According to Teensafe, \\\"Distracted driving accounts for approximately is 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities...58% being teens.\\\" Ironically, teens use phones more than adults as they are more involved with social media websites and apps. Teens, unlike adults, are also more inexperienced at driving, making the act of them using phones even more dangerous than adults. With all the things that people have to pay attention to on the road, it is almost impossible to do both at the same time. \\\"Sending or reading a text causes drivers, on average, to take their eyes off the road for five seconds,\\\" according to Teenlife. Anything can happen in one second when a person's eyes are not on the road, imagine what could happen in five. Whenever a person uses their phone, their chance of being in a crash increases by twenty-three. There are three types of distracted driving and texting fits all three types which is visual, manual, and cognitive. Using a phone causes a person to take their eyes of the road, take their hands off the wheel, and to take their mind off of the road. Because texting can become all three types of distractions, it's arguably the most dangerous action to participate in while driving. Once again, phones have become a major part of the human life, and as a result, people constantly use their phones. Whether it is to check a text or watch a quick video, it is very dangerous to even attempt this while in a car. Operating a phone or any brand or size should not be allowed while operating a vehicle. Using a phone while not driving is not safe and has proven to be deadly. Hopefully, people will learn not to text and drive and be safer on the road.\",\n          \"BOOM!! You're on I-75 on the ground bleeding out watching everyone surrounding you, calling 911. At this point you're thinking to yourself, \\\"why the freak did this happen?\\\" A couple hours later you found out an adult was on his phone texting and driving before the wreck happened, which is the most selfish thing to do while driving. Putting your life and other's lives in danger just so you can send a stupid text to your girl/boyfriend is completely selfish. I firmly believe that we need stricter phone laws to in jail people. Texting while driving is in the top five causes for deaths, and yet many states do not have laws against it. We need to stand together united and encourage our Congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distraction. and be mature and adult-like and discuss ways to not further endanger each other. Cellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it, but I know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change. What's more important to you: a notification or somebody's life? Our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make the roads safer for everyone, we as people need to come together an decide what to do to make things happen, we don't know how much more accidents have to happen in order to push it into effect. We dedicate our selves to our phones,we cant go 10 minuets without trying to see if we got a notification, the time we spend on our phones is tremendous its up to 6 hours a day! Not including the time spent in your bed! If there were something to happen to all of our phone we would go insane,if we would just make stricker laws for phone an driving the people would stop because of the consequences.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 139,\n        \"min\": 173,\n        \"max\": 508,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          508\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
